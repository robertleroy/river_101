  <h3>Buddy System</h3>
  <p>
    Boating alone is not a good idea. Would I do it... yes. Not often, class
    2, easy class 3 in late summer / fall. Kayaking is easy to go to the put
    in and find a group to tag along with. Have done that countless times.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have to admit, rafting alone is different than kayaking alone.. Weigh
    the difficulty of the stretch of river, the current conditions, your skill
    and comfort level with the stretch.. I know fishermen do this all the
    time. And that they spend inordinate amounts of time in big flat eddies.
  </p>
  <p>
    You are going to need people to learn from and with. I can't point you out
    really. Mountainbuzz is a whitewater forum. A bit of fishing talk goes on,
    but it is whitewater, and back in the day, they were pretty blunt about
    that. I am pretty sure it has calmed down a bit since those days. There
    are rafting clubs in the front range, I am sure there is a rafting/fishing
    one (drifters something?).
  </p>

  <br />

  <p>
    Go super easy and get some miles under your belt before you push it. I bet
    if you sat in the parking lot up at Deckers on a weekend you would meet
    people quickly.
